Hello friend! Thank you for having a look at one of my projects!

## About
As one of the (first) projects that are to be built on an online Udemy course "The Web Developer Bootcamp", this project was designed to be a code along for all it's students. However, I am strongly against code alongs and believe that I will learn so much more if I were to do it myself, <b>then</b> when I am finished I can look at the videos to see whether I could have made improvements in terms of best practice, structuring code in a logical sequence and writing code in the most efficient way.

This project is designed to solidify my understanding of HTML, CSS, responsive web design and the <code>Flex</code> box model. 

## Technologies used

## Challenges I faced when building this project
1. <b>Centering the div in the middle of the page</b>: This problem sounds simple, but I'm glad I'm finding my weaknesses now! In order to center the div I attempted to use <code>transform: translate (-50%, -50%)</code>
2. <b>Overflow of button in columns</b>: Without adjusting the height of the container, the 3 buttons would be overflowing.
3. <b>Stacking divs on top of each other on smaller screens</b>: One of the biggest challenges faced. I utilised Google chrome dev tools to see how the pricing panel behaved in different circumstances. I am still unable to figure out how to make space at the bottom of pricing panel in smaller screens.
