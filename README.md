## About
As one of the projects that are to be built on an online Udemy course "The Web Developer Bootcamp", this project was designed to be a code along for all it's students. However, I am strongly against code alongs and believe that I will learn so much more if I were to do it myself, <b>then</b> when I am finished I can look at the videos to see whether I could have made improvements in terms of best practice, structuring code in a logical sequence and writing code in the most efficient way.

This project is designed to solidify my understanding of HTML, CSS, responsive web design and the <code>Flex</code> box model.
